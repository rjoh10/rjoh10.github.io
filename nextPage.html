        <h3>Before The Coffee Gets Cold Series </h3>
        <h5>Toshikazu Kawaguchi </h5>
        <p> The 'Before the Coffee Gets Cold' series revolves around a small, mysterious café in Tokyo named Funiculi Funicula. The café is known for serving a special type of coffee that allows patrons to travel back in time and revisit specific moments in their lives. However, there are certain rules and limitations to this time-traveling coffee. The story atracted me, not jsu because of the concept, but how the concept caputrues the stories of people, and their missed chances, and feelings of regret. </p>
