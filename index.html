                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a big fan of indie, indie rock, and bedroom rap music. My recent favorite artists are Yot Club, Noah Kahan, Mitski, and Skeggs.

                <p>
                    My goal this year has been to complete a book every couple of weeks, and so far that goal has been met! I've included some of my favorite reads so far below!

                <h2>Cafes</h2>
                <p>
                    I take cafe-hopping very seriously, so it is something that I must include here. Boston has so many good spots and I'm excited to see more!
